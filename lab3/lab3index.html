<h1>Lab 3 File Structure</h1>
<p> The purpose of this lab was to better understand the hierarchy of files and
	to navigate through them more efficently</p>
<h2>Issues</h2>
<p>My partner and I struggled to implement an image into the index code, however,
	my partner found a solution through Flickr and asisted me since I was having
	a bit more trouble. </p>
<h3>Results</h3>
<p>After we had everything figured out, we were able to continue with the lab and here are
my results. I was able to create a page with all the links for my labs two through six.
Here is the code index that made this page possible..</p>
