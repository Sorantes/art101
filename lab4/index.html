	<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>My partner and I were to handle the challenge of becoming familiar with
		pseudo-coding and the language of javascript which is displayed below the
		page.</p>
	<h3>Issues</h3>
		<p>We both faced different issues. My partner briefly struggled to link
			their CSS file with the index.html while I accidentally deleted my index
			and had to find a way to recover it.</p>
	<h4>Results</h4>
		<p>Despite the few road bumps we hit, both of us managed to successfully
			implement our rice instructions as well as our Java outline for Pong
			which are both displayed below.</p>

	<div>How to Make Rice

	<pre><code>Pong
		// Create a box for the game space
		  // Create two vertical rectangles on opposite sides
		    // Give the rectangles vertical movement
		      // Add inputs using the up and down arrow keys
		  // Add a dot to middle of screen
		        // Give the dot X and Y movement
		  // Add reaction movement to the dot
		  // Dot moves in reaction to hitting rectangles
