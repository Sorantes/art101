  <p class="light">Please don't leave me to die on this hill alone. I just want to design
    video games!!</p>
  <p class="dark">This actually ain't too bad. I watched some youtube vids and I think I'm
    starting to get the hang of this</p>
  <p class="light">I mean honestly! You know something is wrong when these videos make more
    sense than your four hour and a half lectures!</p>
  <p class="dark">At least my confidence is boosted so I can't complain much
    I suppose.</p>
  <p class="light">Here's to a minor victory!</p>
